## Overview

This library is part of the [DURAARK](http://github.com/duraark/duraark-system) system which manages the DURAARK knowledge graph.

A description on the provided functionality can be found in the reports [D2.5 Software prototype v2, Section 4.3](http://duraark.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DURAARK_D2_5_final.pdf) for an overview and [D3.6 Semantic Digital Interlinking and Clustering Prototype v2](http://duraark.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DURAARK_D3_6.pdf) for details.

### Dependencies

The service depends on the DURAARK component:

* [Focused Crawler](https://github.com/bfetahu/focused_crawling)

### Used By

This service is used by the

* [DURAARK System](https://github.com/duraark/duraark-system)

## Installation

The following instructions will deploy the SailsJS-based service which exports a REST API.

### Prerequisites

The deployment is tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Other Linux distribution should work too, but are not tested. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are used for installation and have to be installed on the system you want to deploy the DURAARK system on. The following instructions assume that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on working on the system. See the above links on how to install them for various platforms. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) has to be installed, too.

It is also possible to install DURAARK on Windows and Mac users via the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/). Installing Docker Compose on windows is possible, but seems to be a bit of a hurdle. See this [Stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29289785/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-windows) for details.

Our recommended stack is to install DURAARK on a Docker-compatible Linux system or to use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to install a Linux virtual machine on your Windows host.

### Installation Steps

On the host you want to deploy the service execute the following steps (assuming that Docker and Docker Compose are installed and working):

```js
> git clone https://github.com/DURAARK/duraark-sda.git
> cd duraark-sda
> docker-compose up -d
```

This will deploy the system in the current stable version (v0.7.0) which exposes its API at **http://HOST_IP:5013/** (http://localhost:5013/ if you did the setup on your local host).

## Development Environment

To setup the environment follow these steps:

```js
> git clone https://github.com/DURAARK/duraark-sda.git
> cd duraark-sda
> npm install
> docker-compose -f devenv-compose.yml build
> docker-compose -f devenv-compose.yml up -d
```

This will build the dockerized development environment. After building the docker container is started and you can access the service at **http://localhost:5013**. Changing the source code will live reload the container.

### Testing

Run **npm test** in the **src** folder.

## Platform Support

This library is running on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and provides a Dockerfile for deployments on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-enabled hosts.

## Public API

We are hosting a public API endpoint at

* http://data.duraark.eu/services/api/sda/

which also provides API documentation for the current stable version.

## Demo

A public demo of the [DURAARK System](http://github.com/duraark/duraark-system) which incorporates this service is available [here](http://workbench.duraark.eu).
